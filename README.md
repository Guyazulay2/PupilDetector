# **PupilDetector** #

This project is a different version of the DeepVOG model, presented in the credits section below.

The original DeepVOG is a framework for pupil segmentation and gaze estimation based on a fully convolutional neural network.
Currently, it is available for offline gaze estimation of eye-tracking video clips.

In this work, we used the DeepVOG model to predict the pupil center coordinates of a given eye image and NOT a video as in the original DeepVOG project. Also, we present the capability to respond to HTTP requests that contain input images, by sending the pupil center coordinates back.
